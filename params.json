{"name":"Ascent","tagline":"Ludum Dare 26 48-hour competition. Theme: Minimalism.","body":"# About the game\r\n\r\nThis is a minimalist platformer in which the only control is to Jump, made for the [Ludum Dare 48-hour Challenge #26](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/). You must ascend to the top by jumping and utilizing springs, switches and platforms.\r\n\r\n# Downloads\r\n\r\n* [Linux amd64](https://github.com/Furyhunter/ld26-minimalism/blob/downloads/ascent-linux-amd64-1.0.zip?raw=true)\r\n* Linux i386 build coming\r\n* Windows build coming\r\n\r\nTo run on Linux, you must have libsfml-system, libsfml-window, and libsfml-graphics installed. To install these on Ubuntu, run the following as root (sudo):\r\n\r\n```\r\n # apt-get install libsfml-*\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Dedication\r\n\r\nThis game is dedicated to my friends Lance Colton (@Tak31337) and Chrystal Carlson, who passed away on April 21st, 2013. Lance was my Java mentor and programming friend in High School who drove our UIL Computer Science team. We had talked of competing in the Ludum Dare Jam multiple times during high school and never had the time to do it, so this is all I can do now.\r\n\r\n# How to build from source\r\n\r\n## Linux\r\n\r\nMake sure you have the development libraries for SFML installed, as well as CMake, and at least version 4.7 of g++.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Furyhunter/ld26-minimalism.git\r\n$ cd ld26-minimalism\r\n$ mkdir build\r\n$ cd build\r\n$ cmake ../\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\nWhen configuring the project in CMake, manually set the libsfml paths in the cache. You need to use mingw32 4.7 or Visual Studio 2012 to build the project as the code makes extensive use of c++11 features.","google":"UA-15906323-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
